        <h1>Garlic Noodles</h1>
        <img src="garlic_noodles.jpeg" alt="garlic noodles picture">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These deceivingly simple, yet devastatingly delicious garlic noodles were invented back in the '70s at a restaurant in San Francisco called Thanh Long. Usually served with roasted Dungeness crab, the recipe is a very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of investigation, and even more experimentation, I think this is very close.</p>
        <p>Apparently, one of their "secret" ingredients is MaggiÂ® Seasoning Sauce, which I decided not to use, since I'm not sure how easy it is for the average person to find. Besides, I think my assortment of savory, umami-rich substitutes did the job quite nicely, and everything in the ingredient list can be found at any large grocery store.</p>
