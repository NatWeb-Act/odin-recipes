        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a wonderful berry crisp. I use a triple berry mixture of raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, but just one works well too! My family loves it! Serve it with whipped cream and it looks great</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups fresh blackberries</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups fresh raspberries</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
